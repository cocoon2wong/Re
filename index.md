## Abstract

Learning to forecast the trajectories of intelligent agents like pedestrians has caught more researchers' attention.
Despite researchers' efforts, it remains a challenge to accurately account for social interactions among agents when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate such social modifications to future trajectories in an explainable and decoupled way.
Inspired by the resonance phenomenon of vibration systems, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to forecast pedestrian trajectories as co-vibrations, and regard that social interactions are associated with spectral properties of agents' trajectories.
It forecasts future trajectories as three distinct vibration terms to represent agents' future plans from different perspectives in a decoupled way.
Also, agents' social interactions and how they modify scheduled trajectories will be considered in a resonance-like manner by learning the similarities of their trajectory spectrums.
Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrian or vehicle, have verified the usefulness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively.

## Highlights

![Motivation of the Resonance Model](./subassets/img/fig_method.png)

- The *vibration-like* prediction strategy that forecasts pedestrian trajectories as multiple trajectory biases to better simulate agents' intuitive behaviors in a decoupled way, including the linear base, the self-bias, and the resonance-bias;
- The *resonance-like* representation of social interactions when forecasting, which regards that social interactions are associated with trajectory spectrums of interaction participators;
