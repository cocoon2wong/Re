## Abstract

Learning to forecast trajectories of intelligent agents like pedestrians has caught more researchers' attention recently.
Despite researchers' efforts, it remains a challenge to accurately account for social interactions when predicting trajectories, and in particular to simulate such social modifications to future trajectories in an explainable and decoupled way.
Inspired by the physical phenomenon of resonance, we propose the \MODEL~(short for \MODELSHORT)~model to forecast pedestrian trajectories as co-vibrations, and regard that social interactions are associated with the spectral properties of agents' trajectories.
Correspondingly, we divide the trajectory prediction pipeline into three distinct vibration terms to represent their trajectory planning from different perspectives (excitations) in an explainable way.
In addition, we model social interactions and how they modify agents' scheduled trajectories in a resonance-like manner by learning the similarities of their trajectory spectrums.
Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrian or vehicle, have verified the usefulness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively.

## Highlights

![Motivation of the Resonance Model](./subassets/img/fig_method.png)

- The *vibration-like* prediction strategy that divides pedestrian trajectory prediction into the direct superposition of multiple vibration portions, i.e., trajectory biases, including the linear base, the self-bias, and the resonance-bias, to better simulate their intuitive behaviors in a decoupled way;
- The *resonance-like* representation of social interactions in trajectories, which regards that social interactions are associated with trajectory spectrums and their similarities of interaction participators.
